This design shows the sequential detector design for detecting the sequence 1011
in SEQ_1 the value got altered which shows the error

if 1 is given as input it will goes to next state if the input is 0 then it will goes to the next state , 
if the the input is 1 then it will goes to the next state if the value is 1 then it will goes as high 
means it detect the sequence 1011 else if it doesnt satisfy the values then again it
goes back to the reset state.
