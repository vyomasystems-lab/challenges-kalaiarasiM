This file shows the bitmanupulation co processor design in which 
ALU is constructed in mkbitmanip.v and is verified with model_mkbitmanip.py

when the value is not matched with the model then it will diplays the error message

in model_mkbitmanip.py the if condition for the given value is not given and is corrected in the level2_ design
